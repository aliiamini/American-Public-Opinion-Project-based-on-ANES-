# American-Public-Opinion-Project-based-on-ANES-
American Public Opinion Project(APOP) aims to study the stability of American Public Opinion based on ANES data sets. 
Adam, Ali, and John are contributing to APOP under the guidance of Pro. Moore from American University. 

This repository contains a pdf file of our final paper, the datasets, the source code for both analysis in R and the machine learning model built in python (which has its own folder, containing the ipynb, the datasets, and the html rendered version of the ipynb), the .qmd file which should (ideally) render both the R script and the python script into a final paper- although there seem to be some issues with the rendering of the file and the python environment.

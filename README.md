# American-Public-Opinion-Project-based-on-ANES-
American Public Opinion Project(APOP) aims to study the stability of American Public Opinion based on ANES data sets. 
Adam, Ali, and John are contributing to APOP under the guidance of Pro. Moore from American University. 

This repository contains a pdf file of our final paper, the datasets, the source code for both analysis in R and the machine learning model built in python (which has its own folder, containing the ipynb, the datasets, and the html rendered version of the ipynb), the .qmd file which should (ideally) render both the R script and the python script into a final paper- although there seem to be some issues with the rendering of the file and the python environment. 

Also please note in lines 54 and 55 of the qmd file, the path to the datasets will need to be replaced with the machine path to the data. Unfortunately, they are too large to upload to github without compression, and are contained within the zipped DSI-Python folder.

How to read this paper: 

Unzip the DSI_final folder, please find the final paper attatched.
